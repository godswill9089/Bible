              organization which has mandate to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ all
               over the world. In the early of months of 2023, amidst the world’s struggles,
                a clear vision was given to re-ignite the transformative power of faith 
                through the spreading the gospel across cultures and languages but in an
                 unconventional way that the world is used. Fueled by a shared vision, the 
                 group brainstormed ways to mitigate the language barriers in a bid for the 
                 Gospel to reach the unreached. The thought of a universal language of 
                 clothing among other tools will serve as a tool of conveyance of this great
                   vision.'

                the earth, pathway to salvation and righteous living are well
                documented in the bible for the average person (even an

                the people and help them to be transformed up to the point that
                the same people are now the embodiment of the scriptures. That
                people shall see the writings and wisdom of the bible through
                the saints. Even when the physical bible is not been carried,
                all the inhabitants of the earth shall see the acts of the
                saints and can clearly identify that they are Christians
                exhibiting all the teachings in the bible. At this point, the
                Bible is no more left on the book but men will be the bible that
                is transported across all over the earth. When they talk, they
                talk scriptures; when they act, they act scriptures; even their
                inactions, will depict scriptures. That means as you reading
                this history travel to other locations, you are the BIBLE that
                other people read, see and emulate due to your actions,
